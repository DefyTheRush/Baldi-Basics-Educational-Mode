# Baldi Basics Educational Mode
A work-in-progress mod for Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning(tm) that allows it to be actually for edutainment purposes

If you need any help with questions, please ask someone for help as BaLdi anD HIs fRIenDs wILL gEt mAd if you get a problem wrong!

Features (So far):
- The 3rd Question in the 2nd - 7th (Last) Notebook is now a normal math problem. It is not nonsense anymore (screech)
- Valid checks for the 3rd Question after 2nd Notebook
- Ability to get more than one prize (just quarters for now)

How to install:
- Extract the Baldi's Basics v1.3.2 game (v1.2.2 may not work so DO NOT TRY IT WITH THAT)
- Drop the new .dll file in "BALDI_Data\Managed\" folder (in the extracted result) and replace the existing .dll (Please copy the old .dll to prevent loss!)
- Load BALDI.exe and enjoy!

Plans for the future:
- Adding a non-scary option after collecting 7th notebook (if you get all of them right)
- Random prizes instead of Quarters (maybe, you can get as many BSoda's you want so far)
- Fixing conditions in the game
- Having options for extras in game:
  - Allowing Baldi's friends to roam around peacefully at the start of game (keep note of what I said above on them getting mad!)
  - Choosing if you want the game to be purely edutainment purposes or have that horror aspect into it as well
  - Allowing full 3D camera movement
  - a faster speed and infinite stamina option for the player (would take ages to go to all places using normal sprint function)

Notes:
- This is still a work-in-progress but feel free to try it!
- For the faster stamina and such option plan, it will be disabled if the player decides to play the game for the "horror" part
